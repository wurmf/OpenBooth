OpenBooth is an Austrian based project started as an assignment at the Technical University Vienna and is developed further in association with Otelo Wien. The Aim of this project is to create a solution for a photobooth that is intuitive to use and creates high quality images.

OpenBooth is an open source software for photobooths optimized for touchscreens. Key features are filters that can be applied, a preview stream that shows the filterd image live and the support of wireless triggering. 

The software uses the gPhoto2 library (http://www.gphoto.org/) and java bindings from https://github.com/mvysny/gphoto2-java/ for the communication with the camera. For the image processing the OpenCV library (https://opencv.org/) is used.
This project is currently in developement and first tests are taking place. 

The development team consists of 5 students with various focal points in computer science.

This whole project is published under the MIT licence. (https://github.com/wurmf/OpenBooth/blob/master/LICENSE)
